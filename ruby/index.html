	<p>Initially, Matz looked at other languages to find an ideal syntax. Recalling his search, he said, “I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python3.”</p>
	<p>In Ruby, everything is an object. Every bit of information and code can be given their own properties and actions. Object-oriented programming calls properties by the name instance variables and actions are known as methods.</p>
	<p>The Litle Ruby SDK follows the above principles providing a simple Ruby implementation of the Litle XML API.  This SDK was created to make it as simple as possible to connect process your payments with Litle. This SDK utilizes the HTTPS protocol to securely connect to Litle, you can start right away by connecting to our Sandbox environment.</p>
	<p>Our Ruby SDK supports all of the functionality present in Litle XML v8. Please see the online copy of our <a href="https://github.com/LitleCo/litle-xml/tree/master/xml_schemas">XSD</a> for Litle XML to get more details on what is supported by the Litle payments engine.</p>
