	<h4>Accessing the Litle Sandbox</h4>
	<p>The Litle Sandbox functions as an emulator of our production environment.&nbsp; You send your transactions to our sandbox environment the exact same way you’d send them to our certification or &nbsp;production systems.&nbsp; The sandbox validates the transaction format and approves it if it matches our requirements.&nbsp; The Sandbox server makes it easy to get started using our SDK’s.&nbsp; <strong>There are no forms to fill out, no credentials required, and no special access needed!</strong></p>
	<p>The Litle Sandbox environment is easily accessible to all users, simply configure your SDK and choose the “sandbox” option.&nbsp; The sandbox is the default option, so it will be chosen automatically if you haven't chosen a destination.</p>
	<p><em><strong>URL:</strong></em> <a href="https://www.testlitle.com/sandbox/communicator/online">https://www.testlitle.com/sandbox/communicator/online</a></p>
	<p><em><strong>Note: Selecting the URL above will result in an error, the sandbox expects xml in the HTTP POST body.</strong></em></p>
	<p>The sandbox uses the request to calculate the response.&nbsp; This is done so that any response that Litle's systems can generate can be retrieved through the sandbox as well.&nbsp; The last 3 digits of a request field will be used to determine the response reason code.</p>
	<p>Authorizations, Sales and all eCheck transactions use the amount.&nbsp; To receive an approval, use an amount that ends with 000.</p>
	<p>Captures, Voids, Credits and Reversals use the litleTxnId.&nbsp; To receive an approval, use a litleTxnId that ends with 000.</p>
