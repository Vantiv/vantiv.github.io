	<h4>Accessing the Litle Sandbox</h4>
	<p>The Litle Sandbox functions as an emulator of our production environment.&nbsp; You send your transactions to our sandbox environment the exact same way you’d send them to our certification or &nbsp;production systems.&nbsp; The sandbox validates the transaction format and approves it if it matches our requirements.&nbsp; The Sandbox server makes it easy to get started using our SDK’s.&nbsp; <strong>There are no forms to fill out, no credentials required, and no special access needed!</strong></p>
	<p>The Litle Sandbox environment is easily accessible to all users, simply configure your SDK and choose the “sandbox” option.&nbsp; The sandbox is the default option, so it will be chosen automatically if you haven't chosen a destination.</p>
	<p><em><strong>URL:</strong></em> <a href="https://www.testlitle.com/sandbox/communicator/online">https://www.testlitle.com/sandbox/communicator/online</a></p>
	<p><em><strong>Note: Selecting the URL above will result in an error, the sandbox expects xml in the HTTP POST body.</strong></em></p>
	<p>This environment is a production simulator. It can only handle online XML and needs at least version 8. It has no state, and doesn't support tied transactions by actually tying the transaction.</p>
	<p>The sandbox uses the request to calculate the response.&nbsp; This is done so that any response that Litle's systems can generate can be retrieved through the sandbox as well.</p>
	<p>For sale and auth, the last 3 digits of the credit card will be used for the response reason code.  Some sample numbers/responses include:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Desired Response</th>
			<th>Credit Card Number</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>000: Approved</td>
			<td>4470330769941000</td>

	<p>On tied transactions, the last 3 digits of the litleTxnId are used as the response reason code.</p>
	<p>This environment is on the public internet and requires no username or password. 
	<p>It is typically used by merchants as their first test environment, while their merchant profile is being created.  Some of our merchants continue to use it during development and maintenance as it provides consistent response codes.
