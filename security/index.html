						<h2>Security</h2>

						<p>Litle &amp; Co. is a PCI DSS Level 1 compliant processor. You can verify this by visiting <a href="http://www.visa.com/splisting" target="_blank">http://www.visa.com/splisting</a> and searching for “litle”. Litle’s first Report on Compliance (RoC) was issued to Visa in 2003, prior to the incorporation of the PCI SSC (Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council) in 2004. This initial independent certification of Litle’s security architecture coincided with our first production transaction processing for early adopters.</p>

We are committed to going well beyond this standard and use it as a baseline for maintaining the highest level of secure operations in the payment processing industry.

Litle is proud to continue a longstanding heritage of actively participating in an unprecedented transformation of the information security landscape over the past 10 years. Our Chief Security Officer is the Litle founding Chief Technology Officer and has helped create a culture within Litle that continuously leverages security to build a world class enterprise. Our security team members all are CISSP certified and hold numerous other certifications. Our company is a member organization in leading security organizations and councils.
