<p>Litle &amp; Co. is a PCI Level 1 Service Provider.  Our continued compliance with the PCI Data Security Standard can be verified on public registries hosted by <a href="http://www.visa.com/splisting">Visa</a> and <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/whatwedo/compliant_providers.html">MasterCard</a>. Litle has received annual Reports on Compliance (ROC) ever since the incorporation of the PCI SSC (Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council) in 2004.

<p>But Litle doesn’t stop with PCI DSS compliance in our quest for security.  We are committed to going well beyond this standard and use it as a baseline for maintaining the highest level of secure operations in the payment processing industry.  Security is integral in everything we do, from Engineering to Information Technology to Finance, Legal, Risk, Compliance, and employee awareness.  Litle is proud to continue a longstanding heritage of actively participating in an unprecedented transformation of the information security landscape over the past 10 years.  We work tirelessly to create a culture within Litle that continuously leverages security to build a world-class enterprise.  Our security team members hold dozens of industry certifications, and our company is a member organization in leading security organizations and councils.  Litle also maintains an unqualified SSAE 16 SOC 1 audit report, NACHA compliance, and is independently audited by our acquiring banks and merchants.</p>

<h4>Secure Transmission</h4>
<p>Litle’s SDK’s utilize the HTTPS protocol, which provides secure and encrypted communication between your company and our processing platform.  Our processing environment is not, and has never been, vulnerable to the <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a> bug.</p>

<h4>Secure Storage</h4>
<p>All of our cardholder data is encrypted whenever it is stored in our systems.  The data can only be decrypted by the processing platform; database and system administrators do not have the keys.</p>

<h4>Secure Processing</h4>
<p>Our developers attend mandatory secure coding training, and have engineered secure methods for ensuring cardholder data during processing. Our source code is regularly audited by third parties for security. Litle has direct connections with Card Associations that follow their stringent security standards. And, Litle has a <a href="https://www.litle.com/solutions/fraud-security/">tokenization</a> solution that can help customers manage their own PCI DSS compliance in a cost effective and secure manner.</p>
