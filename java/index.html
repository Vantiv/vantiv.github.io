	<p>Java is a widely-used general purpose programming language.</p>
	<p>Litle's Java SDK makes it quick and easy to connect your Java back-office system or ecommerce website to Litle's payment platform.  Download our SDK, install it, and start testing against our sandbox environment right away.</p>
	<p>The SDK can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/LitleCo/litle-sdk-for-java/releases">Sourceforge</a>.</p>
	<p>Our source code is located on <a href="https://github.com/LitleCo/litle-sdk-for-java">Github</a> too.</p>
	<p>To install it, run <code>java -jar litle-sdk-for-java-8.13.0.jar</code> and answer the questions.  If you are just trying it out, the username, password and merchant id don't matter, and you should choose sandbox.  This process will create a file in your home directory called <code>.litle_SDK_config.properties</code> with the configuration settings for Litle's SDK.  You can regenerate this file anytime by rerunning, or you may edit the settings here manually.</p>
	<p>Our Java SDK supports all of the functionality present in Litle XML v8. Please see the online copy of our <a href="https://github.com/LitleCo/litle-xml/tree/master/xml_schemas">XSD</a> for Litle XML to get more details on what is supported by the Litle payments engine.</p>
