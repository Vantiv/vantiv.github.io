                    <h2 id="certification">Certification Process Overview</h2>
                    <div>

                    <p>The purpose of the certification process is to verify that your transaction submissions meet the
                        requirements of our online API. Certification testing is a required phase of integrating with
                        our processing platform, and certification testing must be completed and verified prior to
                        production processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you have reached the point where you are comfortable with the SDKs and testing sandbox, you
                        can obtain an account on the official pre-live certification environment by going to
                        https://www.testlitle.com/sandbox/. This is the official test environment that you will
                        ultimately use to perform and complete all required certification testing. You will be able to
                        run through all of the standard test cases, including the standard certification test cases that
                        are listed out in section 2.4 of the Vantiv eCommerce XML Reference Guide. Each transaction type
                        has specific test scenarios that use specific data sets simulating real transactions. The
                        pre-live certification environment responds to each submission with a response, allowing you to
                        verify that you have correctly coded to read the response and store the transaction data
                        returned to you. While all certification test cases are available for your use, you are only
                        required to certify for those transactions that you will be processing in Production. Additional
                        test cases, which you are free to use at any time, are provided within section 2.5 of the Vantiv
                        eCommerce XML Reference Guide. The test account will support basic payment processing
                        functionality, but will not currently support any of the eCommerce platform’s value-added
                        services (VAS).
                    </p>
                    <p>Once an official relationship has been established with Vantiv (either as a merchant or
                        processing partner), this integration project will be added to the eCommerce on-boarding work
                        queue. The next available Vantiv Implementation Consultant will be assigned to the project, and
                        will work directly with you in support of your certification testing efforts. The consultant
                        will be your primary point of contact going forward during the certification testing, so if you
                        have any questions or concerns, you have a direct point of contact to leverage. The consultant
                        will work with you to have the account properly configured, so if you are interested in
                        leveraging any available VAS, your Implementation Consultant will work with you at this time to
                        support the inclusion within your processing integration. Once you have submitted the required
                        certification test cases, the Implementation Consultant will review the cases for completeness
                        and accuracy. If any issues are found, the consultant will provide assistance, and work with you
                        to address. Upon successful completion of certification testing, the Implementation Consultant
                        will provide you with an official certification email specifying details as to what has been
                        certified, i.e. transaction types, connectivity, communication protocols, etc.

                    <p>The successful completion of certification testing signifies the integration’s technical
                        readiness to transition to Production processing with us. There are, however, many other factors
                        that need to be addressed and finalized prior to the commencement of Production processing,
                        including contract finalization, merchant account development, fulfillment of PCI compliance
                        requirements, etc. Your Implementation Consultant will be able to provide direction with regards
                        to next steps towards Production processing.
