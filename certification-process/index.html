<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
</p><section id="subpage-content">
The purpose of the Litle &amp; Co. certification process is to verify that your transaction submissions meet the requirements of the Litle Online API.  Certification testing is a required phase of integrating with the Litle processing platform, and during this testing, a Litle Implementation Consultant will work closely with you in support of your efforts.  Each Litle transaction type has specific test scenarios that use specific data sets simulating real transactions.  The Certification environment responds to each submission with a response, allowing you to verify that you have coded correctly to read the response and store the transaction data returned to you.

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>
</p><section id="subpage-content">
The successful completion of certification testing signifies the integration’s technical readiness to transition to Production processing with Litle &amp; Co.  There are, however, many other factors that need to be addressed and finalized prior to the commencement of Production processing, including contract finalization, merchant account development, fulfillment of Litle’s PCI compliance requirements, etc.  Your Litle Implementation Consultant will be able to provide direction with regards to next steps towards Production processing.
