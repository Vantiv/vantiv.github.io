					<div><hr /></div>
					<p>The purpose of our certification process is to verify that your transaction submissions meet the requirements of our Online API.  Certification testing is a required phase of integrating with our processing platform, and during this testing, an Implementation Consultant will work closely with you in support of your efforts.  Each transaction type has specific test scenarios that use specific data sets simulating real transactions.  The Certification environment responds to each submission with a response, allowing you to verify that you have coded correctly to read the response and store the transaction data returned to you.</p>
					<p>Once you feel comfortable with the SDK test and are ready for official certification testing, please send an email to <a href="mailto:ecom-onboarding@vantiv.com">implementation@litle.com</a> with the following information:
						<ul>
							<li>Merchant or Partner Name</li>
							<li>Your contact from Sales, Business Development or Partner departments (if applicable)</li>
							<li>Contact information for your primary technical resource(s) for the certification phase (e-mail address and phones number)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>An Implementation Consultant will be assigned to work with you in support of your certification testing efforts.  They will be your primary point of contact going forward during the certification testing, so if you have any questions or concerns, you can address them directly.</p>
					<p>A test account will be configured within the certification environment for your use to perform the certification tests.  The Implementation Consultant will work with you to have the account properly configured, and will provide you with the necessary access credentials.   Specific certification test cases are provided within section 2.4 of the Litle XML Reference Guide</p>
					<p>While all certification test cases are available for your use, you are only required to certify for those transactions that you will be processing in Production.  Additional test cases, which you are free to use at any time, are provided within section 2.5 of the Litle XML Reference Guide</p>
					<p>Once you have submitted the required certification test cases, the Implementation Consultant will review the cases for completeness and accuracy.  If any issues are found, the consultant will provide assistance, and work with you to rectification.</p>
					<p>Upon successful completion of certification testing, the Implementation Consultant will provide you with an official certification email specifying details as to what has been certified, i.e. transaction types, connectivity, communication protocols, etc.</p>

					<p>The successful completion of certification testing signifies the integrationâ€™s technical readiness to transition to Production processing with us. There are, however, many other factors that need to be addressed and finalized prior to the commencement of Production processing, including contract finalization, merchant account development, fulfillment of PCI compliance requirements, etc. Your Implementation Consultant will be able to provide direction with regards to next steps towards Production processing.</p>
