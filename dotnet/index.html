	<p>The .NET framework is a family of languages and runtime that is a widely-used as a general purpose programming language.</p>
	<p>Litle's .NET SDK makes it quick and easy to connect your VB.NET, C# or Managed C++ back-office system or ecommerce website to Litle's payment platform.  Download our SDK, install it, and start testing against our sandbox environment right away.</p>
	<p>The SDK can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/litlesdkfordotn/files/">Sourceforge</a>.</p>
	<p>Our source code is located on <a href="https://github.com/LitleCo/litle-sdk-for-dotNet">Github</a> too.</p>
	<p>To install it, just copy <code>LitleSdkForDotNet.dll</code> into your Visual Studio referernces.   You can configure it statically by modifying LitleSdkForDotNet.dll.config or at runtime using the <code>LitleOnline(Dictionary)</code> constructor.  If you are just trying it out, the username, password and merchant id don't matter, and you should choose sandbox.</p>
	<p>Our .NET SDK supports all of the functionality present in Litle XML v8. Please see the online copy of our <a href="https://github.com/LitleCo/litle-xml/tree/master/xml_schemas">XSD</a> for Litle XML to get more details on what is supported by the Litle payments engine.</p>
